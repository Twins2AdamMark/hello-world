# hello-world
just another repository
Spent the past few days shoving my boat up a mountain ,
after I had sealed the deal to swap my house for a cave here,
Its pretty pleasant here looking out from mount trasna across the Connaught countryside,
not many people pass through these parts but thats just how I like it,
maybe tomorrow I will get that off-grid stream powered electric alternator working,
Tiil my next up , take care and God Bless.
